      <div class="faq-container">

        <p class="center">We've gathered the most frequently asked questions about Italian citizenship by descent. Learn about the Jure Sanguinis process, legal requirements, and what documentation is needed for your application.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
          <p>Jure Sanguinis is the Italian law that allows descendants of Italian citizens to reclaim their citizenship by proving uninterrupted lineage. If your ancestor never renounced their Italian citizenship and meets certain legal criteria, you may be eligible for Italian citizenship by descent.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Who is eligible for Italian citizenship through Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
          <p>You may be eligible if:
              <ul>
                  <li>You have an Italian ancestor who was born in Italy.</li>
                  <li>Your ancestor never renounced their Italian citizenship.</li>
                  <li>Your lineage was passed down through your lineage, even if you and your ansestors were born outside of Italy.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the 1948 Rule for Italian citizenship?</h3>
          <p>Before 1948, Italian women could not pass on citizenship to their children. If your Italian lineage involves a female ancestor who gave birth to a descendant before January 1, 1948, you may need to apply through an Italian court, as consulates cannot process these applications. This is often referred to as a "1948 case."</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I still apply for Italian citizenship if my ancestor naturalized in another country?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but with conditions. Your ancestor must have naturalized, or became a citizen of the new country after the birth of the next person in your lineage (i.e., your parent or grandparent). If they renounced their Italian citizenship before their child was born, your eligibility may be affected.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does the process differ if my ancestor was a woman born before 1948?</h3>
          <p>If your Italian ancestor is a woman born before 1948 and your citizenship depends on her, you will need to file your application in an Italian court. This is because, prior to 1948, Italian law did not allow women to transmit citizenship to their children. After 1948, the law changed, but you’ll need a judicial ruling to apply for citizenship in this case.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What documents do I need to apply for Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
          <p>To apply for Italian citizenship by descent, you generally need:
              <ul>
                  <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates of your Italian ancestor.</li>
                  <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates of any direct ancestors in the Italian lineage (your mother/father, grandparent, great-granparent).</li>
                  <li>Your own birth and marriage certificates.</li>
                  <li>Proof that your Italian ancestor did not renounce citizenship before the birth of the next descendant (naturalization or non-naturalization document).
              </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I apply if my ancestor was an Italian woman who married a non-Italian man?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but if the marriage occurred before 1983, your eligibility may be affected. Italian women married to non-Italians before 1983 automatically lost their citizenship, potentially impacting your eligibility.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I apply for Jure Sanguinis if I was adopted?</h3>
          <p>If you were legally adopted by an Italian citizen, you may be eligible for Italian citizenship. However, this is treated differently than Jure Sanguinis and requires additional legal verification.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What happens if my Italian ancestor emigrated before March 17, 1861?</h3>
          <p>Your ancestor must have been alive on or after March 17, 1861, which is when Italy was unified as a nation. If they emigrated or died before this date, they were not technically "Italian citizens," and thus your eligibility would be affected.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I apply through the Italian consulate or do I need to go through court?</h3>
          <p>If you're eligible for Italian citizenship by descent, you can apply either through your local Italian consulate or via the Italian court system. Consulates can take several years to process applications due to high demand, while court proceedings in Italy might be quicker for certain cases, particularly 1948 cases.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does the Jure Sanguinis process take?</h3>
          <p>The timeline depends on whether you apply through a consulate or the court. Consular applications can take several years, while the court process in Italy generally takes 1-2 years, especially for 1948 cases or complex cases.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can multiple family members apply together for Italian citizenship?</h3>
          <p>Yes, family members who share the same Italian ancestor can apply together. This can help streamline the process and reduce costs, as many documents will be shared.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if I don’t have all the required documents?</h3>
          <p>You will need to collect the necessary documents from the relevant Italian or foreign authorities. If you're missing certain documents, your application could be delayed, so it's crucial to gather as much evidence of your ancestry as possible. Citizenship services like ours can assist in obtaining these documents.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the benefits of Italian dual citizenship?</h3>
          <p>With Italian citizenship, you gain:
              <ul>
                  <li>The ability to live, work, and study anywhere in the European Union.</li>
                  <li>Access to Italian healthcare and social services.</li>
                  <li>The right to own property and do business in Italy.</li>
                  <li>Visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to over 180 countries with an Italian passport.</li>
                  <li>Access to tax havens.</li>
              </ul>
