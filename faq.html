        <p class="center">Learn who can apply for Italian citizenship by descent (Jure Sanguinis), the process, legal requirements, and what documentation is needed for your application.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
          <p>Jure Sanguinis is the Italian law that allows descendants of Italian citizens to reclaim their citizenship by proving uninterrupted lineage. If your ancestor never renounced their Italian citizenship and meets certain legal criteria, you may be eligible for Italian citizenship by descent.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Who is eligible for Italian citizenship through Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
          <p>You may be eligible if:
              <ul class="faq-ul">
                  <li>You have an Italian ancestor who was born in Italy.</li>
                  <li>Your ancestor never renounced their Italian citizenship.</li>
                  <li>Citizenship was passed down through your lineage, even if you and your ansestors were born outside of Italy.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What documents do I need to apply for Jure Sanguinis?</h3>
        <p>To apply for Italian citizenship by descent, you generally need:
            <ul class="faq-ul">
                <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates of your Italian ancestor.</li>
                <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates of any direct ancestors in the Italian lineage (your mother/father, grandparent, great-granpdarent, etc.).</li>
                <li>Your own birth and marriage certificates.</li>
                <li>Proof that your Italian ancestor did not renounce citizenship before the birth of the next descendant (naturalization or non-naturalization document).
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I apply through the Italian consulate or can I go through the quicker route which is Italian court?</h3>
      <p>If you're eligible for Italian citizenship by descent, you can apply either 
          through your local Italian consulate or, if you are unable to secure an appointement,
             you can hire an Italian Lawyer to apply on your behalf via the Italian court system. 
              Consulates can take several years to process applications due to high demand, 
                while court proceedings typically take 1 - 2 years.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How must foreign documents be processed for the Italian citizenship application?</h3>
    <p>To be accepted in Italian court or by a consulate, foreign documents must go through these steps:
        <ul class="faq-ul">
            <li><strong>Apostille Authentication:</strong> Documents like birth, marriage, and naturalization certificates must be apostilled, confirming their validity for international use.</li>
            <li><strong>Translation into Italian:</strong> Documents must be translated into Italian by a certified translator. For court submissions, translations must be sworn and certified.</li>
            <li><strong>Certification of Translations:</strong> Translations may need certification by a public notary or consulate, depending on the location of the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Legalization (if needed):</strong> If the country is not part of the Hague Convention, documents will require legalization by the foreign ministry and the Italian consulate.</li>
            <li><strong>Consulate-Specific Requirements:</strong> The requirements may vary by consulate. Some consulates may require additional documents, notarization, additional certification, or specific formatting for documents. It’s important to consult with us to ensure your documents meet the correct standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I don’t have all the required documents or they have not been processed?</h3>
        <p>
          Citizenship Italia’s document procurement team can secure and process the necessary documents as 
            quickly as possible. Your application will require official records from your 
              local government and the Italian authorities. Missing, unprocessed, or improperly processed documents will cause delays.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can multiple family members apply together for Italian citizenship?</h3>
         <p>Yes, family members who share the same Italian ancestor can apply together. This can help streamline the process and reduce costs, as many documents will be shared.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does the Jure Sanguinis process take?</h3>
        <p>The timeline depends on whether you apply through a consulate or the court. Consular applications can take several years, while the court process in Italy generally takes 1-2 years, especially for 1948 cases or complex cases.</p>
       </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the 1948 Rule for Italian citizenship?</h3>
          <p>Before 1948, Italian women could not pass on citizenship to their children. If your Italian lineage involves a female ancestor who gave birth to a descendant before January 1, 1948, you may need to apply through an Italian court, as consulates cannot process these applications. This is often referred to as a "1948 case."</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I still apply for Italian citizenship if my ancestor naturalized in another country?</h3>
          <p>Yes, but with conditions. Your ancestor must have naturalized, or became a citizen of the new country 
              after the birth of the next person in your lineage (i.e., your parent or grandparent). If they renounced 
                their Italian citizenship before their child was born, your eligibility may be affected.</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I apply for Italian citizenship if my ancestor was an Italian woman who married a non-Italian man before 1948?</h3>
          <p>An Italian woman who married a foreign citizen before 1948 lost her Italian citizenship. 
            </p>
      </div>
      

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I apply for Italian citizenship if my ancestor was an non-Italian woman who married an Italian man before 1983?</h3>
        <p>A non-Italian woman who married an Italian man before 1983 automatically acquired 
            Italian citizenship and can still be applied for.</p>
      </div>
    

      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I apply for Jure Sanguinis if I was adopted?</h3>
          <p>If you were legally adopted by an Italian citizen, you may be eligible for Italian citizenship. However, this is treated differently than Jure Sanguinis and requires additional legal verification.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What happens if my Italian ancestor was born or emigrated before March 17, 1861?</h3>
          <p>As long as your ancestor lived passed March 17, 1861, which is when Italy was unified as a nation,
              and meets the other requiremnts, you may be elgible for Italian Citizenship.
          </p>
      </div>
    
    
      
      <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the benefits of Italian dual citizenship?</h3>
          <p>With Italian citizenship, you gain:
              <ul class="faq-ul" >
                  <li>The ability to live, work, and study anywhere in the European Union.</li>
                  <li>Access to Italian healthcare and social services.</li>
                  <li>The right to own property and do business in Italy.</li>
