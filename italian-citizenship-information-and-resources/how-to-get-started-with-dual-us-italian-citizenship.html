      <div class="faq-container">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Use our guide below to find the documents you need to confirm your eligibility for <a style="color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="https://citizenshipitalia.com/italian-citizenship-information-and-resources/what-is-jure-sanguinis-and-how-can-it-be-applied-for.html">Italian citizenship.</a></p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>1. Determine if You Are Eligible</h3>
          <p>Gather Your Ancestor’s U.S. Residence History</p>
          <br>
          <p>Make a list of all places your ancestors lived after arriving in the U.S. (e.g. New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, also include different counties if applicable).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Google how to request digital copies of immigration or naturalization records from the location(s) they lived in the U.S. and the approximate years they would have naturalized (e.g. 1910–1946).</p>
          <br>
          <p>For more recent cases where you're obtaining citizenship through an Italian parent you may need to make a request to USCIS for their immigration records.</p>
          <br>
        </div>
      
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Search for Naturalization Records</h3>
          <p>Use the online resources you found on Google for the specific areas that they lived in (usually National Archives, or local county records) to request digital copies of immigration or naturalization documents from the relevant time period (e.g., 1910–1946).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Include all the variants of their name and birthday you are aware of for a thorough search.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Simultaneously, check genealogy websites like Ancestry to see if your ancestor was listed as an “alien” or “U.S. citizen” in any census data. Note: Census data isn’t 100% accurate, but it can give you clues as to whether they naturalized.</p>
          <br>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>2. What to Look For in Naturalization Documents</h3>
          <p>Once you receive the naturalization records, you’ll typically see one of the following scenarios:</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <ul class="faq-ul">
              <li>
                <p><strong>Naturalized Before Their Child Turned 21</strong></p>
                <p>If both ancestors became a U.S. citizen before their child (whom you descend from) turned 21, you are not eligible unless the woman who you are a descendent of naturalized through marriage (see below).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>No Record of Naturalization or They Never Naturalized</strong></p>
                <p>If there’s no record or they never naturalized, there’s a good chance you qualify for Italian citizenship.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Naturalized After Their Child Turned 21</strong></p>
                <p>If they naturalized after their child (whom you descend from) was 21, you are eligible.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Female Ancestor Naturalized Through Marriage Prior to 1948</strong></p>
                <p>If a female ancestor lost her Italian citizenship through marriage prior to 1948, you are eligible but must pursue an Italian court case (often called a “1948 Case”).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>An Ancestor who Naturalized In or after 1992</strong></p>
                <p>After 1992, Italy allowed dual citizenship. Therefore, an ancestor who naturalized at that time often retained the ability to pass on Italian citizenship..</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
