        <h3>List of Steps and Progress Tracker</h3>
        <p>
            This list of steps and editable progress tracker is a resource I (Spencer, Head of Customer Services) created for my relocation to Italy. While it offers valuable guidance, it’s absolutely essential that you conduct your own research to understand the specific processes for the municipality you’ll be living in. Steps and requirements can vary across regions, and immigration is a serious matter that demands thorough preparation.
        </p>

        <h3>Step Tracker & Organizer</h3>
        <p>
        I’ve created a Google Sheets checklist designed to help you track, organize, and plan each step of the process while keeping all essential information in one centralized location. You can easily clone, edit, and customize the file to fit your specific needs and the requirements of your comune.

        <h3>1. Gather Your Documentation</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="faq-ul">
                <li>Vital Records: Birth, marriage, and death certificates for yourself and your ancestors.</li>
                <li>Naturalization Records: Proof of whether your ancestor naturalized, including certificates or "no record found" statements.</li>
                <li>Apostilles and Translations: Authenticate non-Italian documents with apostilles and certified translations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Notes: This is not an in-depth guide for assembling your JS documents, this blog exists to help those who have already assembled their package or those looking into the requirements for relocation. If you need any assistance assembling your documentation — you know who to call 😎😎😎😎</p>

        <h3>2. Get an Italian Fiscal Code (Codice Fiscale)</h3>
        <p>
            The Codice Fiscale is an essential identification number in Italy and it’s required for almost every subsequent step. You can learn more about obtaining your code using <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/english/nse/individuals/tax-identification-number-for-foreign-citizens" target="_blank">this link</a>.

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>3. Secure Accommodation Prior to Coming</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Renting:</strong> Find a rental property, sign a lease agreement, and ensure the contract is registered with the Agenzia delle Entrate and legalized as per your municipality's standard for proof of residency.<br>
          <strong>Staying with Friends or Family:</strong> Obtain a notarized Declaration of Hospitality (Dichiarazione di Ospitalità) and copies of your host's lease or property deed and utility bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> In Both Cases:</strong> look at your comune’s requirements and ensure you collect the required documents such as utility bills or other proof of residence in your, or your landlord’s name.
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: If looking to rent — many short-term landlords will not want to go through the process of registering a contract. An easy workaround to this is finding a suitable Airbnb or short-term rental and offering to pay extra for a contract. I would start by offering an additional month's rent if they provide and register a contract. A month’s rent in Italy is typically significantly lower than in the US or Canada.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>4. Travel to Italy</h3>
      <p>
          Enter Italy on a suitable visa (American + Canadian citizens can usually stay up to 90 days).
      </p>
      <p>
          Choose a comune (municipality) where you’ll apply for residency and submit your JS application. Ensure the comune you’re staying in has familiarity with processing JS applications.
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: When planning this step, consider flying directly into Italy from a non-Schengen country (i.e., a country outside the EU). By doing so, you’ll receive a passport stamp upon entry, allowing you to skip step 5 (in most municipalities) — saving you from what could otherwise be an exhausting and time-consuming experience.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>5. Declare Your Presence (Dichiarazione di Presenza)</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Entering from a Non-Schengen Country:</strong> Ensure your passport is stamped upon arrival. This stamp acts as your declaration. However, in some municipalities, it is expected that you complete this step regardless of your stamped passport (this was the case for me).
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Stay at a hotel or Airbnb:</strong> Italian law requires your host to report your arrival to local authorities within 24 hours. To avoid issues, confirm with your host in advance that they will comply with this requirement. Again, double check what is accepted in your municipality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Entering from a Schengen Country:</strong> Visit the local Questura within 8 days to officially declare your presence.<br>
          Ensure you bring your flight ticket, passport, flight booking, and all evidence that you just flew into the country.
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: Questura sucks. I, a grown man that maybe cries 2-3 times a year, was almost brought to tears by an immigration officer screaming at me at the top of their lungs for reasons I still cannot decipher. Show me someone that likes Questura and I WILL show you a masochist. Be prepared for chaos.

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>6. Apply for Residency</h3>
      <p>
          Go to the local Ufficio Anagrafe with the required documents (some of which include):
          <ul class="faq-ul">
              <li>Passport and visa (if applicable)</li>
              <li>Proof of accommodation</li>
              <li>Declaration of Presence (Dichiarazione di Presenza)</li>
              <li>Completed residency application form (dichiarazione di residenza)</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>7. Securing a Permesso di Soggiorno Appointment</h3>
      <p>
         <strong> Obtain the Application Kit:</strong> Visit a local post office (Poste Italiane) offering the "Sportello Amico" service to collect the application forms (kit giallo).
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: this may require you to visit 4 or 5 different Poste Italiane locations before you find one that has this kit in stock. Make a list of all the suitable Postes in your vicinity and expect that this could take anywhere from a few hours to a full day.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Complete the Forms:</strong> Fill out the forms in Italian. Seek assistance if needed to ensure accuracy.
      </p>
      <p></p>
          Gather Required Documents (some of which include):
          <ul class="faq-ul">
              <li>Valid Passport: Include photocopies of all relevant pages.</li>
              <li>Visa: If applicable, a copy of your entry visa.</li>
              <li>Proof of Accommodation: Documents as outlined above.</li>
              <li>Proof of Financial Means: Bank statements or other evidence showing sufficient funds.</li>
              <li>Health Insurance: Proof of valid health coverage in Italy.</li>
              <li>Four Passport-Sized Photos: Recent and identical.</li>
              <li>Revenue Stamp (Marca da Bollo): A €16 stamp, purchasable at a tabaccheria.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong> Submit the Application:</strong> Return to the post office with the completed forms and documents. The clerk will review your application, provide a receipt (serving as a temporary permit), and schedule an appointment at the local police headquarters (Questura).
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: Download the Poste Italiane App or use the website and schedule your Poste Italiane appointment in advance. This may save you hours of waiting.
      </p>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>8. Residency Check</h3>
      <p>
          During a 45-day window after you apply for residency, a police officer (vigile) will visit your residence to verify your presence.
      </p>
      <p>
          After verification, you’ll receive a certificato di residenza (residency certificate).
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: It’s important to remain at home during this period to be present for the police check. Ask the worker who processes your residency application how it typically works in your region.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>9. Secure a Jure Sanguinis Meeting at the Comune</h3>
      <p>
          Visit the Ufficio di Stato Civile at the comune to request an appointment for your JS citizenship application. This is sometimes done through an online application or email.
      </p>
      <p>
          Provide your certificato di residenza and explain that you’re applying for Italian citizenship through Jure Sanguinis.
      </p>
      <p>
          Schedule a meeting and confirm the list of required documents for your specific comune.
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: You will need to have submitted your JS application before going to your Permesso appointment.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>10. Apply for Permesso di Soggiorno</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Attend the Questura Appointment:</strong> Bring original documents, undergo fingerprinting, and complete the formalities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>Bring Copies:</strong> Although they will have copies of everything you submitted originally, I brought copies of everything in the event anything was lost or damaged. I always find it’s best to be overprepared rather than returning to the Questura.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Await Processing: </strong> Use your receipt as a temporary residence permit until your Permesso is ready.
      </p>
      <p>
          Notes: Keep a photo of your receipt and passport on your phone. Police checks are common, especially at train stations or on trains, and you could be detained if you cannot prove your legal right to be in the country.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>11. Submit the Jure Sanguinis Application</h3>
      <p>
          At the scheduled meeting:
          <ul class="faq-ul">
              <li>Present all documents (some of which include):</li>
              <ul class="faq-ul">
                  <li>Certified vital records (birth, marriage, and death certificates).</li>
                  <li>Proof of naturalization or non-naturalization for your ancestor.</li>
                  <li>Apostilles and translations for all foreign documents.</li>
                  <li>Your certificato di residenza.</li>
                  <li>Your permesso di soggiorno receipt (if applicable).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Provide any additional documentation required by your specific comune.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>12. Await Processing</h3>
      <p>
          The Ufficio di Stato Civile will verify your documents and contact the relevant consulate or authorities to confirm the accuracy of your ancestor’s records.
      </p>
      <p>
          Processing can take anywhere from a few weeks (in my case) to 36 months.
